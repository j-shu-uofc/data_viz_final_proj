# 1. Introduction
For many high school graduates in America, the next step after graduation is attending college. Pursuing a secondary education is widely seen as a way to further one's career prospects, which in turn brings financial opportunities. However, the outcome of a college education is not in fact equal.

This project asks the question, "how do American undergraduate, four-year colleges provide financial opportunities to students? What kinds of inequalities are present in college"

In particular, this project aims to consider the following questions:

* Ivy League+ colleges?
* Top 150 US News?
* Has the 'bang for buck' trend shifted over time?

# 2. Data and Methods 

This project utilizes the [College Scorecard Dataset](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data) provided by the U.S. Department of Education. Data is provided at the institution and field-of-study level for each year from 1996-97 to 2022-23. The dataset was filtered for four-year colleges only; this was to facilitate equitable analysis across colleges. The webpage that contains this report was created using [Distill in RMarkdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/), and the visualizations were rendered using Altair.

For determining the return on investment (ROI) on colleges, I attempted to compare median costs of attending with the median income of employed graduates. 

# 3. Results and Analysis

First, I wanted to explore broadly if there were obvious differences in between the types of school ownership: public, private non-profit, and private for-profit.
